# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational linguist and software developer.
Most of my work so far has been in Python, with a focus on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
I'm trying to move away from that!

## ðŸ˜„ Pronouns

I use they/them pronouns! In German you can use any that are not male or female gendered. Check out my [pronouns.page](https://de.pronouns.page/@LexiBlesius) for more details or languages!
